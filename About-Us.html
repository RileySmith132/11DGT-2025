            <p id="about-paragraph">Riley's Eggs is a family-owned business that began in 2015 when a young boy returned home to find 30 chickens nestled in a brand new chicken coop. Inspired by the simple joys of raising chickens and producing fresh, high-quality eggs, Riley quickly turned this unexpected gift into a thriving business. What started as a humble venture in their backyard has now grown into a trusted local supplier known for its farm-fresh, sustainably produced eggs. With a commitment to ethical farming practices, Riley's Eggs provides customers with a product they can feel good about, knowing it comes from a place where the chickens are well cared for and the eggs are always fresh.</p>
